  Description:

  Are you an engine manufacturer? Or a manufacturer of construction, agricultural, maritime, or other off-highway machinery and equipment? Your customers need to know that these assets are ready to roll when and as required.


  Updates over the air (OTA) – e.g., for rolling out new software or firmware packages – can help reduce downtime and maintenance efforts. What’s more, they can also optimize the performance of industrial assets in the field.


  But what is the impact on your current business? What challenges do you have to consider? And finally, what role will OTA play in the coming years?


  To answer those and further questions, over-the-air update specialists join our expert panel. Register now to benefit from their experience and to address your questions!
